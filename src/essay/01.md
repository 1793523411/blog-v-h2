## iconfont Select icon Sao operation

I ran into a problem when using iconfont today: I want to use all the icons in an icon library, but he didn’t provide a select all button, so I don’t have to click one by one.

After reading the comment, there is such an article: What does the console do, start it directly with js code

He also provided a string of codes to select all the icons in these icon libraries

### The first step is to introduce jquery

```js
var j = document.createElement("script");
j.setAttribute(
  "src",
  "https://ajax.microsoft.com/ajax/jquery/jquery-1.4.min.js"
);
document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0].appendChild(j);
```

### The second part begins to select all

```js
$("span[title='添加入库']").each(function() {
  $(this)
    .delay(500)
    .click();
  console.log(
    $(this)
      .parent()
      .prev()
      .children()
      .eq(0)
      .html()
  );
});
```

After pressing Enter, the console will output for a while, and finally see that all the icons have been selected, hahaha, and then I can continue my operation😆
