# Summary for January 2021

It‚Äôs been a good month

## Event Overview

At the beginning of the month, I finished the exam and then came back home. That means, one-third of the month I was playing, then I came back home and adjusted and started to study. The kind that repeats every day. I studied for many days. The Alibaba trainee program began, then you realize that the course needs your full attention or you won‚Äôt be able to continue, and that‚Äôs the most powerful experience of the month

## Perception and reflection

First of all, just after the exam to play, play in school, come back to play, is finished for a long time before the beginning of learning, this is to improve on the condition of adjustment

Then is in the stage of self-study at home, once again feel good article, take notes, every day adhere to brush the algorithm problem, and then look at the CSS related data (desert teacher‚Äôs illustration CSS3) , right to start every day to look at the face, make notes, later, I felt that this way is not quite right, so I stopped for a while, and so on for some days

Finally, the Alibaba Trainee program began, this is the beginning of a nightmare, began to think, the trainee program courses and my own schedule, at the same time, but the first day I changed my mind, since most of the courses are within Ali‚Äôs technology stack, and I haven‚Äôt had much exposure to them, fortunately, they are based on React, so I immersed myself in this trainee program every day, occasionally floundering around algorithm problems, reading CSS Books, but it was only a symbolic struggleüòÇ

What‚Äôs interesting is that when I was on the team, I was somehow made captain, and then I had four team members, three juniors, a sophomore, a Kenichi, later, because of the too many tasks assigned by their tutors and unable to devote themselves fully to the student training program, that graduate one quit. In fact, many graduate students in the large group also quit because of this, and so on, the four of US went through the program together, from daily classes to homework, to writing requirements documents and discussing final projects, to project completion, to the end of the project presentation video, to the last day of January, because the video is due on February 1st

Let‚Äôs think about the whole course of learning it, because involved in all areas of Ali, difficult is normal, the most let me feel happy is, several times the teacher‚Äôs praise homework.

The first is the micro-front, the teacher said to the students a like, the only three classes were praised, Ha Ha Ha.

The second was web front-end routing, not directly praised at the time, but took my routing implementation code, talked about, and pointed out my unreasonable.

The third was the nodejs section, which used Eggjs for task assignment, and several were praised by the teacher who listed my name and said I was the only one in the class who used the queue, jS Foundation and data structure and algorithm foundation is good, can make me happy

The fourth time is the midway piece, in the live broadcast can see, a class as long as I submitted this assignment, and the teacher also took my assignment to speak, this teacher can I admire a big boss

The fifth time is the visualization section, the beautiful lady listed three homework representatives, including me, Ha Ha Ha Ha

Above, I remember several times praising, once I thought I would be praised, but there wasn‚Äôt any, that is, the cross-end part. The live broadcast talked about a lot of homework, the homework content was relatively simple, it was two todoList and a picture page, and a drawing question

Small program write Todo I lazy use RAX, the teacher said some people used a third-party framework to complete this assignment, suitable for the RAX that said

The todo of ReactNative may be that my interface isn‚Äôt pretty, and the teacher doesn‚Äôt talk as much as I do, but I wrote in the assignment that when rendering a long list, like anything over 1000, it gets stuck, and the teacher talked about this problem for me and said it might be a component problem, because RN has two components that render scrolllists

Rax, the assignment for drawing the page was actually said by the teacher that this student had a high degree of completion. Among them, I was actually lazy. I didn‚Äôt write the drawing page myself. It was generated directly with imgcook (time is really not enough) . However, the teacher might not have looked carefully, so I felt a little bad about being praised by the teacher

But I also learned a lot through the course and the homework live here, first of all, the todo assignment, which every student will do, but I didn‚Äôt consider the style and code specification in order to finish it quickly, and then the little program Todo, the teacher gave me his todo, which made me immediately feel that this todo was awesome, taking into account the operation of the small program to the data, saving performance to the greatest extent, and not the general kind of adding, deleting, modifying, and checking, but using the global hanging in the state, todolist is implemented by listening to events via status, which is really great, really learned, the teacher style is also very nice, the interaction is very good, the code is also very canonical, from a small todo can learn so much, I just double click 666

The last interactive course and intelligent course, I look very bad, one is the 3d, although contact, but not deep to learn, intelligent first contact, it is too painful, for this last course, in fact, I on 3D, the game engine was quite interesting, but the teacher said it was very difficult at first, and the time didn‚Äôt allow him to do it very slowly. He suddenly felt it was very difficult, or he had too little contact with this aspect, i actually plan to learn more about interactivity in the future

Intelligent I really is listening to the days book, work directly with Python, I also transflow also installation error, resulting in installation is not, it is very uncomfortable, after the front-end intelligent will certainly develop very well, this area or efforts

I built a scaffolding for the final project, a quick-to-use messaging subscription, and I wrote a document for him (opens new window)[ÊñáÊ°£](http://alert-doc.ygjie.icu/)

Scaffolding built-in 5 templates, I wrote 2, three team members each wrote one (scaffolding is also written by me, Ha Ha Ha) , and finally by the team members boast reliable, happy, probably because I always send my finished homework to the group, then I did a lot of final projects, such as requirements documentation, scaffolding, documentation, and two documents, and I felt a little coddled with them

Finally recorded a project demo video, and then the team‚Äôs only sister edited a bit, even if the completion of this final project, do not know can be in the top six, hope can be in

On the whole, this trainee program has learned a lot. It is really challenging my ability boundary every day. I have also gained the improvement of studying source code, analyzing source code and thinking mode, and also greatly broadened my horizon, the most memorable is the job to write the fly ice plug-in, configuration webpack and then to change the webpack after the file, now in retrospect, everything is pretty good

## It‚Äôs at the end

When I finished the project, I happened to see a message from Ali looking for an internship. I wrote my resume and sent it to my senior. Then the senior also praised me for my good resume. Ha Ha Ha, I was so happy. The senior said it was a communication resume from years ago, after years of interviews, and do not count in the system, I was this cast, the most important thing is that I wrote my first resume

Finally, the final is a good preparation for the interview, February is no accident is a good preparation for the interview, so in March after the official commencement of the school, I can go to the interview with confidence, I hope all this can be smooth
